As for the second installment, [dev.to/davidedelpapa/rocket-tutorial-02-minimalist-api-2kl6](https://dev.to/davidedelpapa/rocket-tutorial-02-minimalist-api-2kl6), we talk about how to concot a minimalist toy API.

In the third installment, [dev.to/davidedelpapa/rocket-tutorial-03-proper-routing-4ch3](https://dev.to/davidedelpapa/rocket-tutorial-03-proper-routing-4ch3), we get a more standard API, and a way to store (in memory) the data we are interested to collect and deliver through our API.

There's also an interlude, [dev.to/davidedelpapa/rocket-tutorial-03-part-ii-proper-testing-6h](https://dev.to/davidedelpapa/rocket-tutorial-03-part-ii-proper-testing-6h), on properly testing our API, to guard against regressions as well.

The fourth installment will talk about how to integrate a MongoDB database with our Rocket API, in order to use it to collect and retrieve data. 
Hope you enjoy! Stay tuned for more to come!
